## Fig 1. Long-range occipital-parietal streamlines primarily target the posterior hippocampus

(A) The mean ± SD cross-sectional area of hippocampal streamlines belonging to each hippocampal system (anterior, body, posterior) as a function of streamline length. Areas are log10 transformed to facilitate visualization. (B) Differences in the average cross-sectional area of streamlines belonging to each hippocampal system, for streamlines of varying length (short: < 20m, medium: 20-40mm inclusive, long: >40mm). Error bars reflect 95% confidence intervals. 
(C) Example single-subject tractogram (11.9 year old male), with streamlines colored by their termination in the hippocampus (pink: posterior, green: body, blue: anterior). (D) One-versus-rest analysis showing the ROIs which preferentially terminate in a specific hippocampal system. (E) For a single example subject, the density of streamline endpoints are plotted. On the top: endpoint density is overlaid on a 3D hippocampal surface. On the bottom: endpoint density is overlaid on a sagittal slice of the T1-weighted image.
